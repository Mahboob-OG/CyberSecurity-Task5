# 📡 Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## 📌 Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)
- Web Browser (to generate traffic)
- Command Prompt (for ping commands)

## 📊 Protocols Identified
1. **DNS** (Domain Name System) - Resolves domain names to IP addresses
2. **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) - Connection-oriented communication
3. **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - Web page transfers
4. **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) - Encrypted web traffic

## 📁 Files Included
- `network_capture.pcap` - Actual packet capture file
- `protocol_analysis.md` - Detailed analysis of captured protocols
- `screenshots/` - Wireshark interface and filter examples

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Successfully captured 150+ packets in 1 minute
- Identified multiple protocols using Wireshark filters
- Observed TCP handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Captured DNS queries and responses
